	<h1> Conclusion</h1>
	<p>In the first term of our web development we studied how to develop a webpage using the html codes. It was interactive and was user friendly for use to code the webpage. We were able to develop a webpage using the code in the html. The web development was very interactive and was user friendly so that we were able to code the programming easily without any fault. It also helped us to gain knowledge about the instances in the html codes and to create a new webpage and we were able to find a solution for the coding of the program. I found learning sources like w3school where the best when you are just getting started. Just be advised that this method of learning gets more interactive when we get used to it. We can do responsive design without any additional framework, but its far easier with the help of a responsive framework like CSS. We got a well-developed knowledge about using html and was simpler for me to code a webpage after reading the code given by the html and was able to create a webpage of our own.</p>
	<p>The wireframe image of the webpage is given below </p>
	<p><img src="wireframe.png" alt="wireframe" width= "640" width= "320">
	<p>This is the wire frame image which we made using the webpage code this wire frame image is the basic model of the webpage and we coded for each and every content in the webpage. The wire frame gives a clear picture of the webpage which is been coded.</p>
